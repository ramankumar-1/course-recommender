Acoustic Materials And Metamaterials,"The study of electromagnetic and acoustic waves is an endeavor that dates back centuries. An important sub-domain of this field that effects our daily life is the use of acoustic principles to control environmental noise. In this regard, acoustic materials, which are materials designed to manipulate sound wave propagation, are of prime importance. Within this field, about three decades ago, the concept of metamaterials was proposed that has created a revolution. Theoretical formulation and experiments have shown the feasibility of realizing man-made acoustic metamaterials that can manipulate waves beyond the defined limits of those found in nature. Therefore, within a time span of 15 years, acoustic materials have emerged as an active field driven by scientific discoveries and diverse application potentials in machinery noise control, frequency filtering, speech transmission technology, acoustic imaging, and cloaking. This is the first-ever organized coursework on acoustic materials with a special focus on acoustic metamaterials. This course will cover the following topics:

AI:Constraint Satisfaction,"Human beings solve problems in many different ways. Problem solving in artificial intelligence (AI) is inspired from these diverse approaches. AI problem solvers may be based on search, on memory, or on knowledge representation and reasoning. An approach to problem solving is to pose problems as constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), and employ general methods to solve them. The task of a user then is only to pose a problem as a CSP, and then call an off-the-shelf solver. CSPs are amenable to combining search based methods with reasoning. In this 2 credit course we will look at general approaches to solving finite domain CSPs, and explore how search can be combined with constraint propagation to find solutions.

Analog Electronic Circuits,"This course on Analog Electronic Circuits has been designed primarily as a core course for undergraduate students and, as a refresher course for master level students and circuit designers working in industry. It starts with basic circuit components and circuit concepts and then, gradually moves to practical building blocks of analog electronic systems. In this course, a serious attempt has been made to make a balance between theory and practice so that the discussed circuits can be constructed in an undergraduate level laboratory class and their measured performance can be easily compared with the analytically predicted performance. It helps to build confidence on theory. 
The other important feature of this course is, it covers both BJT based circuits and MOSFET based circuits parallel so that similarities and performance differences between these two classes of circuits are understandable. Moreover, the BJT based circuits discussed here can be easily constricted on bread board to verify their characteristic through measurement. On the other hand, analysis of the MOSFET based circuits provides the necessary foundation for Analog VLSI circuit/system design, a next level course in Microelectronics and VLSI Design.

Furthermore, the algorithmic question of PIT is related to proving circuit lower bounds. We then move on to proofs, or attempts to prove, that certain problems are hard and impossible to express as a small circuit (i.e. hard to solve in real life too). One such problem is Permanent. We study the hardness against restricted models-- diagonal circuits, homogeneous depth-3, homogeneous depth-4, noncommutative formulas, multilinear depth-3, multilinear formulas, read-once ABP, etc. The partial derivatives, and the related spaces, of a circuit will be a key tool in these proofs. The holy grail here is the VP/VNP question. Depending on time and interest, other advanced topics could be included.

Conservation Economics,"The times are changing: we live in an era when issues such as climate change, over population, pollution, habitat loss and mass extinction of species are no longer just academic concepts; we are witnessing them in our daily lives and suffering their consequences. We are continuously trashing our planet and harming ourselves in the process. And this is when we know so much about what the issues are, how and why they arise, and how they can be solved. We have the technological solutions; and still we?re largely unable to actually solve the problems. This is largely because these problems require not just a technological solution ? they also require reworking of national and global policies. And solving the problems will entail costs and require money ? such as for treating waste water before disposal, for increasing the efficiency of resource utilisation to reduce overconsumption of resources, for shifting to greener sources of energy that don?t emit greenhouse gases, for shifting to green chemistry that doesn?t pollute, for making infrastructures that do not harm the wildlife, and for incentivising more research to make better technologies. It is these costs, and not just a lack of technology, that prevent us from solving the problems. Thus, the need of the hour is to understand the Economics of Conservation to create an environment where we can use technologies to solve our problems. In this course, we shall look at the processes of Conventional Economics that have led to the destruction of the environment by putting profits above everything, and how we can solve these issues of Conventional Economics with a better understanding of Economics ?

Introduction To Algebraic Geometry And Commutative Algebra,"Algebraic geometry played a central role in 19th century math. The deepest results of Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, and the most important works of Klein and Poincar/âe were part of this subject. In the middle of the 20th century algebraic geometry had been through a large reconstruction. The domain of application of its ideas had grown tremendously, in the direction of algebraic varieties over arbitrary fields and more general complex manifolds. Many of the best achievements of algebraic geometry could be cleared of the accusation of incomprehensibility or lack of rigour. The foundation for this reconstruction was (commutative) algebra. In the 1950s and 60s have brought substantial simplifications to the foundation of algebraic geometry, which significantly came closer to the ideal combination of logical transparency and geometric intuition. Commutative algebra is essentially the study of the rings occurring in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. In algebraic number theory, the rings of algebraic integers in number fields constitute an important class of commutative rings â the Dedekind domains. This has led to the notions of integral extensions and integrally closed domains. The notion of localization of a ring (in particular the localization with respect to a prime ideal leads to an important class of commutative rings â the local rings. The set of the prime ideals of a commutative ring is naturally equipped with a topology â the Zariski topology. All these notions are
widely used in algebraic geometry and are the basic technical tools for the definition of scheme theory â a generalization of algebraic geometry introduced by Grothendieck.",ma,12,/noc/courses/noc22/SEM1/noc22-ma06

Language And Mind,Language learning can be put under three broad perspectives. Some believe language is pairing of lexicon and syntax i.e. of words and the set of rules that defines how we can combine those words most fundamental of these rules are innate i.e. they are already there in the human mind before it is exposed to society. This means there is perhaps an innate Language Faculty. Still others believe that General Cognitive Abilities that account for other kinds of learning can also account for language. There are many others who strongly believe that language is essentially socially embedded and that all learning takes place through social interactions. This course will briefly account for the most convincing position and will argue for it from generative perspective and biological foundations of language.

The quality of learning of the graduating engineers determines the quality of their placements. While there was significant research in the last few decades in our understanding of how people learn, there have not been many intersections of this knowledge with the instructional practices at institutions of higher learning. The dominant instructional method still remains lecturing. Industry, Regulatory Bodies and Accreditation Agencies in India want the engineering graduates to attain a set of Program Outcomes (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) which are discipline agnostic and a set of Program Specific Outcomes identified by the Department offering the program. The curriculum of a program decides the nature of learning experiences, including the courses, projects, internships, and co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.
The focus on students attaining a specific set of outcomes requires a shift from a teacher-centric approach to student-centric instruction. While good teachers, in any era or in any part of the world, were and are always student-centric in their approach, the process of designing and conducting a course remained informal in nature. The contexts of instruction including quality and background of students, teacher expertise, the physical environment and the system in which instruction takes place, available resources, regulatory and accreditation mechanisms, and assessment and evaluation mechanisms are very varied. There is no unique method that leads to good learning in all contexts. The course addresses many of the common issues of teaching and learning in engineering in the Indian context and tries to provide a complete solution to a teacher to the process of design and conduct of an engineering course leaving all the academic freedom he/she wants to have. While at some places, the suggested solutions appear to be specific, they can be treated as examples, and alternate solutions can be worked out by the teacher. 
In the present-day context, all the teachers have a very important role in getting their engineering programs accredited by NBA. An understanding of all the criteria of NBA SAR will facilitate the teachers to understand the",ge,12,/noc/courses/noc22/SEM1/noc22-ge01

Probabilistic Methods In PDE,"Probabilistic method in PDE is equally used in Pure and Applied Mathematics research. This is regarded as a very powerful tool by the researchers working on the theory of differential equations. However, as the topic demands expertise on both PDE and probability theory, an initiative to teach the topic as a structured course is vastly absent globally, including in India. There is hardly any lecture note or a course accessible for the mathematics students. There is no book for mathematics students which focuses on this topic and assembles all important aspects suitable for an introduction to this topic. Young researchers like PhD students or junior postdoctoral fellows, who aspire to learn the topic, resorts on several different books and study by themselves, which often consumes considerable amount of their productive time.

To change the present discouraging scenario and to boost up research on this very powerful and vibrant topic, I have designed this introductory course. I have offered this once informally at IISER Pune and then officially at Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany for research students. This course, although an advanced one, attracts students with a background of PDE, Probability Theory, Mathematical Finance, or Mathematical Physics.

Programming In Modern C++,"There has been a continual debate on which programming language/s to learn, to use. As the latest TIOBE Programming Community Index for August 2021 indicates â C (13%), Python (12%), C++ (7%), Java (10%), and C#(5%) together control nearly half the programming activities worldwide. Further, C Programming Language Family (C, C++, C#, Objective C etc.) dominate more than 25% of activities. Hence, learning C++ is important as one learns about the entire family, about Object-Oriented Programming and gets a solid foundation to also migrate to Java and Python as needed. C++ is the mother of most general purpose of languages. It is multi-paradigm encompassing procedural, object-oriented, generic, and even functional programming. C++ has primarily been the systems language till C++03 which punches efficiency of the code with the efficacy of OOP. Then, why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? This is where the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11 and several later offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate some of the long-standing shortcomings for C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics, and better readability. The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 / C++03. Besides the constructs, syntax and semantics of C++ (over C), we also focus on various idioms of C++ and attempt to go to depth with every C++ feature justifying and illustrating them with several examples and assignment problems. On the way, we illustrate various OOP concepts. The course also covers important advances in C++11 and later released features.

Spread Spectrum Communications And Jamming,"A spread spectrum communication system deliberately spreads the spectrum of the signal beyond the required bandwidth needed for information transmission to achieve resilience against hostile jamming, low probability of intercept resulting detectability to be almost impossible as compared to non-spread signals, inherent message privacy and security, good rejection of multipath signals, high degree of ranging precision (due to the large bandwidth involved), and compatibility with code division multiple access (CDMA) capability. Originally adopted in military networks as a means of ensuring secure communication when confronted with the threats of jamming and interception, spread spectrum systems are now the core of commercial applications such as mobile cellular and satellite communications. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the first commercial communication system that uses spread spectrum signals enabling ranging, jamming protection, multipath protection and high degree of range precision. In todayâs world, there are more applications of spread spectrum on the commercial side than on the military side. CDMA is a popular multiple access scheme where several users share the same physical medium, that is, the same frequency at the same time. CDMA is based on spread spectrum technique where the spectral band is spread by multiplying each userâs signal by unique orthogonal pseudorandom sequence. Orthogonality of the codes ensures the retrieval of information without interference from each other where spreading allows the receiver to take benefit from multipath properties of the mobile radio channel. Over the years, the most successful implementation of spread spectrum communication in commercial world lies in cdma 2000, WCDMA and UMTS, a 3G mobile communication system, WLAN, Ultra Wideband Communications (UWB), Body Area Networks, and energy efficient Radio Architecture design for future generation Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communications. The common cordless phone utilizes spread spectrum technology to provide a telephonic interference-rejecting communication link in both 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands. In addition, spread spectrum communication methods have been considered an alternative to hard wiring for indoor private branch offices, laboratories, or factories where the transmission medium involves severe multipath fading.

However, the principles of statistical thermodynamics can be used to analyze such situations, and other situations too. Therefore, this course will cover both classical and statistical aspects to provide a complete set of tools to a biological engineer to thermodynamically analyze bio-systems. Such an analysis will help in manipulation and design of bio-systems.",bt,12,/noc/courses/noc22/SEM1/noc22-bt16

molecular diffusion, which is the transport in a stationary fluid due to gradients in concentration
or temperature. The combination of convection (transport by flowing fluids) and diffusion
determine the rate of transport, and the overall efficiency, in unit operations. In this course, we
will obtain a physical understanding of how the balance between convection and diffusion
determines the overall transport rates in chemical processes, and gives rise to many of the

AI: Constraint Satisfaction,"Human beings solve problems in many different ways. Problem solving in artificial intelligence (AI) is inspired from these diverse approaches. AI problem solvers may be based on search, on memory, or on knowledge representation and reasoning. An approach to problem solving is to pose problems as constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), and employ general methods to solve them. The task of a user then is only to pose a problem as a CSP, and then call an off-the-shelf solver. CSPs are amenable to combining search based methods with reasoning. In this 2 credit course we will look at general approaches to solving finite domain CSPs, and explore how search can be combined with constraint propagation to find solutions. This course is a companion to the course ?¢â¬ÅArtificial Intelligence: Search Methods for Problem Solving?¢â¬Â? that was offered recently and ?¢â¬ÅArtificial Intelligence: Knowledge Representation & Reasoning?¢â¬Â? that is being offered concurrently.

Appreciating Carnatic Music,"Carnatic music is a vibrant musical tradition that has evolved, and is largely practiced, in Southern India and wherever else there is a significant diaspora of South Indians. 
A highly nuanced and tonally rich melodic music, its rhythmic aspect too is considerably complex. As much as it is rooted in tradition there is immense demand on the improvisational skills of the musicians. The coming together of these two aspects in a concert can give the listener a musical high.
What makes this music so unique and rich? What happens in a typical concert? What do we look for? Who were the great musicians and composers who have made the music what it is today? These are some of the questions this course will try to answer.
What does a student need to bring to this course? An interest in music, a willingness to bite into a music technically and aesthetically very different from popular music-s and other forms like Western Classical music.
It would help if you have heard Carnatic music before, but that is not absolutely necessary. You will hear plenty during the course.",hs,8,/noc/courses/noc15/SEM2/noc15-hs03

Basic Statistical Mechanics,"In order to understand natural phenomena like phase transitions or nucleation or many biological reactions like protein folding, enzyme kinetics, we need to understand how many particles interact and behave together in certain specified manner. For example, ice melts at 00 C and water boils at 1000 C, at low temperature the rain drops form in the upper atmosphere. Enzyme beta-galactosidase allows the breaking of the C-O bond that leads to the digestion of lactose .These are complex processes which involve many particles to behave in a collective fashion. This could happen because of the interaction among particles. However, these cannot be solved by Newtonâs equations, because we cannot solve Newtonâs equations even for three particles interacting system.

Commutative Algebra,"Commutative algebra is essentially the study of the rings occurring in algebraic number theory and
algebraic geometry.
In algebraic number theory, the rings of algebraic integers in number fields constitute an important
class of commutative ringsâ the Dedekind domains. This has led to the notions of integral
extensions and integrally closed domains.
The notion of localization of a ring (in particular the localization with respect to a prime ideal leads
to an important class of commutative ringsâ the local rings.
The set of the prime ideals of a commutative ring is naturally equipped with a topologyâ the
Zariski topology. All these notions are widely used in algebraic geometry and are the basic technical
tools for the definition of scheme theoryâ a generalization of algebraic geometry introduced by
Grothendieck.
The main purpose of this course is to provide important workhorses of commutative algebra
assuming only basic course on commutative algebra. Special efforts are made to present the concepts
at the center of the field in a coherent, tightly knit way, streamlined proofs and a focus on the core
results. Virtually all concepts and results of commutative algebra have natural interpretations. It
is the geometric view point that brings out the true meaning of the theory. The main focus in the
course are the folloing core results :
â¢ Noetherâs Normalisation.
â¢ Dimension theory.
â¢ Homological characterisation of Regular local rings.
â¢ Discrete Valuation rings and Dedekind Domains.
Apart from deepening the knowledge in commutative algebra, participants of this course are
prepared to continue their studies in different directions, for example, algebraic geometry. Another
possible direction to go in computational aspects of commutative algebra.

Concentration Inequalities,"It is well-known that functions of large numbers of random quantities tend to behave rather predictably and less randomly than their constituents. For instance, the laws of large numbers tell us that the average of many independent random variables is asymptotically the expected value. higher-order refinements such as the central limit theorem and large deviations techniques uncover the asymptotic rate at which this reduction in randomness takes place. However, if one is interested in sharper estimates, for the probability of deviation from the typical value, for a fixed number of observations, for functions other than the average, or for functions of dependent random variables, one must take recourse to more specific measure concentration bounds. Perhaps the most basic, nontrivial examples in this regard are the Markov and Chebyshev inequalities, which are encountered in a first course on probability.

 This graduate-level course on concentration inequalities will cover the basic material on this classic topic as well as introduce several advanced topics and techniques. The utility of the inequalities derived will be illustrated by drawing on applications from electrical engineering, computer science and statistics. A tentative list of topics is given below.

Conservation Geography,"Geography is the study of areal differentiation. It examines three questions - 1. What features (say mountains) and processes (such as volcanism) are found in different locations? 2. Why are they located where they are? 3. Where else on Earth do we find these specific features and processes? This governs several developmental decisions, such as location of mines, factories, towns, cities, and infrastructure. After all, mining will be economically feasible in areas that have a concentration of ores. Factories can easily be set up where we have availability of land, labour, capital and infrastructure. Towns and cities require land, infrastructure, water, etc. But at the same time, areal differentiation also governs the localisation of biodiversity - forests, wildlife, etc. - which need to be conserved to provide us with ecosystem benefits like food, water, disease control and employment. Past experience shows that if we are not careful, hasty developmental decisions harm biodiversity and conservation - especially when, say, developing mines in biodiversity-rich areas. This ultimately affects all of us - destruction of ecosystems, water flows and pollution wreck havoc to food and water security, health and economic development. The present course examines these concepts, beginning with the basics of Geography and Conservation, and looking at their interplay through several case studies to help reach conservation-oriented development.",bt,12,/noc/courses/noc21/SEM2/noc21-bt44

Financial Derivatives & Risk Management,"Regulatory reforms across the world are gradually being introduced to reduce trade impediments between nations and usher in free market based pricing. Cross border investments through direct/portfolio routes are also being enticed as a medium for funding of growth and developmental activities. In addition, the governments of developing nations continue to pursue their strategy of partial privatization of the frontier sectors in an attempt to raise revenues for the exchequer as well as reduce operational losses with increased efficiency. Under these stimuli, scientific risk management by the investor fraternity becomes of cardinal necessity for generating competitive returns and surviving in the marketplace. Derivatives have proven to be immensely useful in the management of financial risk. Their vitality can be gauged from the exponential growth in trading volumes as well as the advent of new structured products literally on a day to day basis.

Foundations Of Wavelets And Multirate Digital Signal Processing,"The word 'wavelet' refers to a little wave. Wavelets are functions designed to be considerably localized in both time and frequency domains. There are many practical situations in which one needs to analyze the signal simultaneously in both the time and frequency domains, for example, in audio processing, image enhancement, analysis and processing, geophysics and in biomedical engineering. Such analysis requires the engineer and researcher to deal with such functions, that have an inherent ability to localize as much as possible in the two domains simultaneously.This poses a fundamental challenge because such a simultaneous localization is ultimately restricted by the uncertainty principle for signal processing. Wavelet transforms have recently gained popularity in those fields where Fourier analysis has been traditionally used because of the property which enables them to capture local signal behavior. The whole idea of wavelets manifests itself differently in many different disciplines, although the basic principles remain the same.Aim of the course is to introduce the idea of wavelets. Haar wavelets has been introduced as an important tool in the analysis of signal at various level of resolution. Keeping this goal in mind, idea of representing a general finite energy signal by a piecewise constant representation is developed.

Galois Theory,"Galois Theory is showpiece of a mathematical unification which brings together several different
branches of the subject and creating a powerful machine for the study problems of considerable
historical and mathematical importance. This course is an attempt to present the theory in such a
light, and in a manner suitable for undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers.
This course will begin at the beginning. The quadratic formula for solving polynomials of degree
2 has been known for centuries and is still an important part of mathematics education. The
corresponding formulas for solving polynomials of degrees 3 and 4 are less familiar. These
expressions are more complicated than their quadratic counterpart, but the fact that they exist comes
as no surprise. It is therefore altogether unexpected that no such formulas are available for solving
polynomials of degree â¥ 5. A complete answer to this intriguing problem is provided by Galois
theory. In fact Galois theory was created precisely to address this and related questions about
polynomials. 
The participant is expected to have a basic knowledge of linear algebra, but other that the course is
largely self-contained. Most of what is needed from fields and elementary theory polynomials is
presented in the early lectures and much of the necessary group theory is also presented on the way.
Classical notions, statements and their proofs are provided in modern set-up. Numerous examples
are given to illustrate abstract notions. These examples are sort of an airport beacon, shining a
clear light at our destination as we navigate a course through the mathematical skies to get there.

Gender Justice And Workplace Security,"The issue of gender justice has been a matter of discussion and deliberation, both at the international and national levels. With the increased participation of women in all walks of life, particularly at the workplace and the breaking of hitherto social, political and religious gender barriers, the issue has assumed significance and become subject- matter of debate at all levels including law. Today, women are donning multiple roles, apart from being a homemaker- they are working as top executives in MNCs, working as legislators in State and Central legislatures, working as educators in the education sector, etc. While the changed societal matrix & perception and economic globalization have made way for the increased participation of women, the concern over the free play of discriminatory attitudes and prejudicial mindsets often pose challenges to women and targets of multi-facet retaliations and disincentives. The incident of Nirbhaya in the Capital of the Nation not only exhibits how such treatment is basically an anathema to the concept of gender justice but also exposes the barbaric mindset annihilating the values of basic civilization. The days of yore when women were treated as fragile, feeble, dependent and subordinate to men, should be a matter of history. 
The course is aimed at acquainting the participants with the concept of gender justice.From the arena of Constitutional guarantees to criminal law to laws ensuring safety at the workplace, specifically sexual harassment, the course will focus on understanding the laws, its procedural intricacies and judicial decisions aimed at strengthening the position of women in society.

Globalization And Culture,"Globalization is one of the most talked about words in the contemporary world and dominates discussions in

the media, academics and everyday life. Cultural theorists have used the term to refer to political, economic,

social and cultural transformations that have occurred in the last decade of the twentieth century. It appears

that everyone on the planet is affected by globalization but not in the same way. Yet most people have only a

fuzzy understanding of what globalization means because of the number of things it means to a wide variety of

people. The different dimensions of globalization such as the rise of global capital and markets, new media and

communication technologies, dissolution of political borders, and growth of consumerist culture cannot be

seen in isolation from one another. But people tend to examine them separately or through the

compartmentalized frames of different disciplines.

To provide a thorough grounding in the philosophical and theoretical debates on globalization



To examine the economic, political, social, cultural issues covered by the debate and their impact on

contemporary cultures, particularly in the developing world

The common themes of all these philosophies are unity and diversity (advaita and dvaita) in their understanding, interpretation of the existence of reality, and explanation of the attainment of liberation (moksha). 
They had been formulated mostly from 1,500 BC to a few centuries A.D. with critical investigations and creative ways of philosophically interpreting socio-political-economic issues of existential importance. Thus, thinkers of any tradition strongly viewed that philosophy as a study of practical necessity needs to be cultivated in order to understand 'how life can best be led?'. 
The Indian philosophical systems are classified into two groups on the basis of the acceptance of Vedas; Orthodox and Heterodox System. The orthodox systems are: Vaisheshika, Ny?ya, S?mkhya, Yoga, Purva-Mim?ns?, and Uttar-Mim?ns? (Ved?nta). All these systems encapsulate in three pairs, namely Ny?ya-Vaisheshika, Yoga-S?mkhya, Mim?ns?-Ved?nta. In each of these pairs, the first system is concerned with the practice and the second one is elucidated its theoretical bases. However, all these systems are discussed with a critical approach to their theories in this course. In addition to these, Ch?rvaka School, Jainism and Buddhism systems are analyzed as part of the heterodox system. Over and above, an introductory note to Indian Philosophy is placed at the beginning of the course.",hs,12,/noc/courses/noc15/SEM1/noc15-hs05

Linear Regression Analysis And Forecasting,"Forecasting is an important aspect of any experimental study. The forecasting can be done by finding the model between the input and output variables. The tools of linear regression analysis help in finding out a statistical model between input variables and output variable which in turn provides forecasting. For example, the yield of a crop depends upon the area of crop, quantity of seeds, rainfall etc. The statistical relation between yield and area of crop, quantity of seeds, rainfall etc. can be determined by the regression analysis and forecasting can be done to know the yield in future. The accuracy of forecasting depends upon the goodness of obtained model. What are its steps and checks required to obtain a good model and in turn, how to do forecasting is being aimed to be taught in this course.",ma,4,/noc/courses/noc17/SEM1/noc17-ma08

Literary And Cultural Disability Studies: An Exploration,"Like other human conditions, disability offers a unique vantage position in the understanding of cultural expressions such as literature, folklore, and film. Such a vantage position derives from disabilitys capacity to offer novel frameworks for interpreting academic institutions such as literary criticism. Why that should be the case? 

Human capacities, abilities, vulnerabilities, and a spectrum of sentiments determine how long, and in what direction an idea travels. Likewise, conditions such as madness may instill newer narrative dispersions that one can ill afford to ignore. Literary and Cultural Disability Studies (LCDS) is the most appropriate forum for examining such narrative maneuverings. That said, LCDS is much more than that. For example, as a lens for exploring literary and cultural arrangements, LCDS may aid us in addressing the following questions differently:

1 The canon question.
2 The art of interpretation involving text and contexts.
3 The multilingual question. To comprehend the enduring connect between disability politics and the multilingual question, we have an elaborate workshop on Indian Sign Language (ISL). And 
4 Interdisciplinarity and the problem of accommodation. 

An engagement with these questions renders LCDS as a sequel to my introductory course on Disability Studies. Students pursuing masters in literature, culture, and social sciences broadly may appreciate the diversity of content in this course. For those who are pursuing doctoral and postdoctoral research, this course may come handy too. It hosts lectures and conversations on methods, frameworks, and approaches concerning culture, language, and politics. In sum, students from humanities and social sciences may relish myriad cultural debates surrounding disability, as much as its treatment as an interpretative method.

Mapping Signal Processing Algorithms To Architectures,"Digital Signal Processing typically involves repetitive computations being performed on streams of input data, subject to constraints such as sampling rate or desired throughput. Often such systems need to be implemented under tight constraints on factors such as timing, resources, power or cost. When they are used in embedded systems, it is often worth the effort to design custom architectures that have much better cost tradeoffs than general purpose computing architectures.

This course deals with the analysis of such algorithms, and mapping them to architectures that are either custom designed or have specific extensions that make them better suited to certain kinds of operations. Topics covered include fundamental bounds on performance, mapping to dedicated and custom resource shared architectures, and techniques for automating the process of scheduling. Aspects of architectures such as memory access, shared buses, and memory mapped accelerators will be studied.

NBA Accreditation And Teaching - Learning In Engineering (NATE),"The quality of Teaching and Learning in Engineering has come to be an important issue in India to all stakeholders including teachers, students, parents, Managements, University, AICTE, NBA, and Industry, especially after the introduction of new Accreditation Process introduced by NBA in 2015. The quality of learning of the graduating engineers determines the quality of their placements.  While there was significant research in the last few decades in our understanding of how people learn, there have not been many intersections of this knowledge with the instructional practices at institutions of higher learning. The dominant instructional method still remains lecturing. Industry, Regulatory Bodies and Accreditation Agencies in India want the engineering graduates to attain a set of Program Outcomes (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) which are discipline agnostic and a set of Program Specific Outcomes identified by the Department offering the program.  The curriculum of a program decides the nature of learning experiences, including the courses, projects, internships, and co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.
The focus on students attaining a specific set of outcomes requires a shift from a teacher-centric approach to student-centric instruction.  While good teachers, in any era or in any part of the world, were and are always student-centric in their approach, the process of designing and conducting a course remained informal in nature.    The contexts of instruction including quality and background of students, teacher expertise, the physical environment and the system in which instruction takes place, available resources, regulatory and accreditation mechanisms, and assessment and evaluation mechanisms are very varied.  There is no unique method that leads to good learning in all contexts. The course addresses many of the common issues of teaching and learning in engineering in the Indian context and tries to provide a complete solution to a teacher to the process of design and conduct of an engineering course leaving all the academic freedom he/she wants to have.  While at some places, the suggested solutions appear to be specific, they can be treated as examples, and alternate solutions can be worked out by the teacher. 
In the present-day context, all the teachers have a very important role in getting their engineering programs accredited by NBA. An understanding of all the criteria of NBA SAR will facilitate the teachers to understand the",ge,12,/noc/courses/noc20/SEM1/noc20-ge11

Our Mathematical Senses Part 1: Geometry Of Vision,"This course will explore how one of our senses -- our sense of sight -- relies on our brain's seemingly hardwired understanding of a fascinating geometric space. What's more, this space -- known as the two dimensional Projective Plane -- is surprisingly different from the familiar Euclidean plane.

By examining some basic questions related to perspective drawing, like why parallel lines appear to converge in our vision, we can identify and analyze the defining properties of this space - properties which are well known to our visual sense, but defy our logical intuition.

As the course progresses, we will situate perspective drawing in the framework of Projective Geometry, and get familiar with the algebra of homogeneous coordinates, which will allow us to translate our sensory intuition into precise information we can easily communicate. We will also get to know the topological space known as the real projective plane, as well the matrix group that governs its transformations.

Being a four-week long elective, this course will nicely complement standard courses on geometry and topology, by giving hands-on experience with several important mathematical objects you will meet in those classes.  Some basic linear algebra will be required, especially in the final week of the course (in particular, we will assume familiarity with vector calculus and with matrices as linear transformations).

As part of the series Our Mathematical Senses, we plan to offer follow-up courses in subsequent semesters, exploring our sense of spatial orientation (the Topology of Movement) and our sense of hearing (the Calculus of Sound)",ma,4,/noc/courses/noc21/SEM2/noc21-ma77
Parallel Algorithms,"A conventional algorithm uses a single processing element. A parallel algorithm assumes that there are multiple processors. These processors may communicate with each other using a shared memory or an interconnection network. An algorithm designed for a large number (for example, a polynomial in the problem size) of processors can be simulated on a machine with a small number of processor  for a trade off on time, and therefore is of practical value, while at the same time allowing us to test the limits of parallelism. Many algorithmic design techniques in the parallel setting will be explored. Parallel complexity theory will also be briefly studied.  ",cs,12,/noc/courses/noc19/SEM1/noc19-cs17
Parameterized Algorithms,"This is a first course on techniques in parameterized algorithms, a paradigm of algorithm design that analyzes running time in finer detail than classical complexity theory: instead of expressing the running time as a function of the input size only, dependence on one or more parameters of the input instance is taken into account. This is a fast-evolving field and a fundamental approach to coping with NP-hardness, alongside approximation and randomized algorithms. The course will be a natural follow-up to a first course in algorithms and data structures for theoretically-inclined students and those who are curious about approaches to dealing with the theoretical limitations that emerge from the theory of NP-completeness.

Remark 1. A companion course might cover topics focused entirely on lower bounds (covering W-hardness, ETH and SETH-based hardness, hardness based on the UGC, and hardness of kernelization). A natural follow-up course might cover topics in the intersection of parameterized and approximation algorithms.

Performance And Reward Management,"In the present highly competitive environment, what organizations strive to uncover is, what is it that can take them ahead of their competitors? Or in other words, what can be their competitive advantage? The answer lies in what we have been considering for ages as human resources but indeed is the key organization resource; we refer to as, ÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬Ãâ¦Ã¢â¬Åhuman capitalÃÆÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢â¬Å¡ÃÂ¬ÃâÃÂ today.  Any organization that succeeds in retaining motivated employees can pull off successfully in turbulent times by maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage through its motivated and talented human capital.  But the question is; how to retain and make sure that an organization moves hand in hand with its human capital. Performance and Reward management is the key which offers a basis to an organization to turn and transform its human capital as its strategic business advantage.

Programming In C++,"There has been a continual debate on which programming language/s to learn, to use. As the latest TIOBE Index for April 2016 indicates Ã¢â¬â Java (21%), C (14%), C++ (6%), C#(4%), and Python (3%) together control nearly half the programming community. Given this, it is still important to learn C and C++ because of the efficiency they offer. While we appreciate that Java is good for applications, for graphics; and we acknowledge that Python is appropriate for portable software, engineering problem solving, and graphics; it is worth bearing in mind that the JVM and Python interpreter are indeed written in C++, making C++ the father of all languages today. Well, hence, C++ is the systems language. Why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? This is where the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11, C++14, and C++17 offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate some of the long-standing shortcomings for C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics and better readability.

The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 and C++03. Besides the constructs, syntax and semantics of C++ (over C), we also focus on various idioms of C++ and attempt to go to depth with every C++ feature justifying and illustrating them with several examples and assignment problems. On the way, we illustrate various OOP concepts.

While this course can be understood independently (after a course in C programming), it would help in developing understanding in OOP. Hence this course is advised in conjunction with OOP.",cs,8,/noc/courses/noc16/SEM2/noc16-cs17

field of Randomized Algorithms. Often, the randomized variants, in addition
to being faster than their deterministic counterpart, are simpler to understand

We prove hardness results for the problems of parity and clique using randomized methods. We construct `highlyâ-connected graphs called expanders that are useful in reducing randomness in algorithms.

Security Analysis & Portfolio Management,"Regulatory reforms across the world are gradually being introduced to reduce trade impediments between nations and usher in free market based pricing. Cross border investments through direct/portfolio routes are also being enticed as a medium for funding of growth and developmental activities. In addition, the governments of developing nations continue to pursue their strategy of partial privatization of the frontier sectors in an attempt to raise revenues for the exchequer as well as reduce operational losses with increased efficiency. Under these stimuli, scientific investment management by the investor fraternity becomes of cardinal necessity for generating competitive returns and surviving in the marketplace. Financial instruments have proven to be immensely useful as versatile investment avenues. Their vitality can be gauged from the exponential growth in trading volumes as well as the advent of new structured products literally on a day to day basis.; Most courses in this area do not cover investment theory as a cogent wholesome.

Design of Courses in an Instructional System Design framework and planning the Instruction (Module 2 and Module 3) follow after designing good Course Outcomes in the framework provided by NBA.
The quality of Teaching And Learning in Engineering (TALE) has come to be an important issue in India to all stakeholders including teachers, students, parents, Managements, University, AICTE, NBA and Industry. The quality of learning of the graduating engineers determines the quality of their placements.  Industry, Regulatory Bodies and Accreditation Agencies in India want the engineering graduates attain a set of Program Outcomes (knowledge, skills and attitudes) which are discipline agnostic and a set of Program Specific Outcomes identified by the Department offering the program.  The curriculum of a program decides the nature of learning experiences including the courses, projects, internships, and co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.
The focus on students attaining a certain set of outcomes requires a shift from teacher centric approach to student centric instruction.  While good teachers, in any era or in any part of the world, were and are always student centric in their approach the process of designing and conducting a course remained informal in nature.The contexts of instruction including quality and background of students, teacher expertise, physical environment and the system in which instruction takes place, available resources, regulatory and accreditation mechanisms, and assessment and evaluation mechanisms are extremely varied.  There is no unique method that leads to good learning in all contexts. The course TALE addresses many of the common issues of teaching and learning in engineering in the Indian context and tries to provide a complete solution to a teacher to the process of design and conduct of an engineering course leaving all the academic freedom he/she wants to have.

Transport Processes I - Heat And Mass Transfer,"Physical and chemical transformations of raw materials to products are accomplished in unit
operations which involve mixing, heating/cooling, reactions and flow. The efficiency of these
processes is critically dependent on the transport of heat and mass carried along with flowing
fluid, and across solid/fluid interfaces. The transport across interfaces is entirely due to
molecular diffusion, which is the transport in a stationary fluid due to gradients in concentration
or temperature. The combination of convection (transport by flowing fluids) and diffusion
determine the rate of transport, and the overall efficiency, in unit operations. In this course, we
will obtain a physical understanding of how the balance between convection and diffusion
determines the overall transport rates in chemical processes, and gives rise to many of the
empirical correlations used in chemical engineering design.",ch,12,/noc/courses/noc20/SEM1/noc20-ch10

Urbanization And Environment,"With more than 50% of the world population now residing in cities since 2008 (World Urbanization Prospects, 2007), we have reached the urban moment with huge implications of planetary urbanization on the environment. Urbanization is not a new phenomenon; the ancient cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, Ancient Greece, Rome and Mesopotamia are strong evidences. However, with our entry to the era of the Anthropocene, rapid urbanization with its rate, scale and shifting geographies (with intense urbanization in the global south: Asia, Africa and Latin America) is upsetting the ecological balance complemented with rising inequity, displacement and loss of livelihoods affecting the urban poor.

 What is the solution? Should urbanization be perceived as the key challenge and strategies must be devised to halt it, if not reverse it (as it is irreversible) Can there be other innovative alternatives that do not perceive cities as consumptive spaces swallowing ecological resources and generating highest ecological footprints, but also as contributors to ecological sustainability

 While policy prescriptions laid out in the UN Sustainable Urbanization framework or Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer technocratic directions and guidelines, it is extremely important to empirically investigate the relationship cities and their wider environments to not only identify challenges but also map potentials and learn lessons towards the development of a robust resilient urban environmental matrix that will not only be technically sound and feasible but also informed by socio-economic and political realities and determinants. With lessons from emerging urban social sciences frameworks such as urban environmental history and urban political ecology and with the empirical focus on South Asia, the course will shed light on cities as complex socio-natural-technical assemblages, encompassing elaborate technical apparatus and intricate social arrangements evolved along shifting temporal scales and development imperatives. Finally, by capturing storylines in the making of urban nature involving multiple stakeholders (government, foreign agencies, civil society and communities), the larger agenda of this course is to transcend theoretical research on the relationship between urbanization and environment into practical actions towards a just, inclusive and resilient (urban) world order.",hs,8,/noc/courses/noc21/SEM2/noc21-hs96

Wildlife Conservation,"Conservation of wildlife is important, not only because animals like pandas are cute, or animals like tiger or elephant are majestic, and we want to have them with us; it is also important for the provisioning of several ecosystem services and the proper working of the ecosystem itself, of which we too are a part. In this course, we shall discuss the several facets of wildlife conservation, including its importance and the threats being faced, and also how they are being managed in the field. We shall explore how to capture wild animals, how to treat them when needed, how to manage their habitats and their populations, and so on. We'll use the case study approach with real-life examples from the field to get a better understanding of this field and its applications.

Wildlife Ecology,"Wildlife is an enamouring ï¬eld for most of us. In my professional tenure, I have observed numerous people ï¬ocking to get a glimpse of the tiger, to get an opportunity of diving with the ï¬shes, or to get access to a National Park or a Wildlife Sanctuary. And these experiences gets even more endearing when you get to know how the show is getting managed, how and why we regulate access, and also how we maintain grasslands and water bodies to keep the systems up and running. This course will cover one such aspect of wildlife management by providing an overview of the ï¬eld of Ecology, and also how it is being used in the understanding and management of our wildlife resources. In this course, we will use the case study approach with real-life examples from the ï¬eld to get a better understanding of the ï¬eld and its applications",bt,12,/noc/courses/noc20/SEM2/noc20-bt38
Wireless Ad Hoc And Sensor Networks,"Wireless communication technologies are undergoing rapid advancements. The last few years have experienced a steep growth in teaching and research in the areas of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. These networks have emerged to be attractive in many civilian and military applications and they hold great promises for our future. 

The attractiveness of ad hoc networks, in general, is attributed to their characteristics/features such as ability for infrastructure-less setup, minimal or no reliance on network planning and the ability of the nodes to self-organize and self-configure without the involvement of a centralized network manager, router, access point, or a switch. These features help to setup a network fast in situations where there is no existing network setup or in times when setting up a fixed infrastructure network is considered infeasible, for example, in times of emergency or during relief operations. Likewise, sensor networks, wherein communication takes place with the help of spatially distributed autonomous sensor nodes equipped to sense specific information, have emerged to be very popular. They find a variety of applications in both the military and the civilian population worldwide such as in cases of enemy intrusion in the battlefield, object tracking, habitat monitoring, patient monitoring, fire detection and so on.

Work System Design,"Work System Design deals with the systematic examination of the methods of doing work with an aim of finding the means of effective and efficient use of resources and setting up of standards of performance for the work being carried out. The systematic examination of work involves Ã¢â¬â what is done? And how it is done? As well as what is the standard time to do the work? This is required to have an in-depth analysis of all the elements, factors, resources and relationships affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the work being studied. The course also aims at scientifically establishing the time required for a qualified worker to carry out a work element at a defined rate of working. Ergonomic aspects of work system design are also included in the course contents. The scope of this course is not only limited to the manufacturing applications but it is also relevant for service sector industry.",me,12,/noc/courses/noc18/SEM2/noc18-me68
Working Capital Management,"Working capital management has gained the attention of industry and academia as an exclusive area of study after liberalization of Indian Economy. Management of working capital sometimes becomes more important than the management of long term funds because the day-to-day operations of any business largely depend upon this source of finance. Many firms have been seen in the past closing down for the want of short term finance. The profitability of any business to a larger extent is affected by this source of finance due to efficient management of current assets and current liabilities. Hence, learning about managing working capital has become more important and critical in the modern scenario.",mg,12,/noc/courses/noc18/SEM2/noc18-mg40
X-ray Crystallography & Diffraction,"The properties of any crystalline material are very much functions of its crystal structure and internal arrangement of atoms. X-ray diffraction is an elegant method to determine crystal structure and related parameters. This course provides a glimpse of how X-ray diffraction can be used to solve various crystallographic problems of both single and polycrystalline materials, starting from an elementary level.

Yarn Manufacture I : Principle Of Carding And Drawing,"Carding and drawing are two fundamental process in yarn manufacture. In carding the fibre
tufts are opened , cleaned and separated thoroughly by fast moving pinned surfaces and then
reassembled to form a nice 2D array of fibres which is subsequently transformed into an
uniform sliver. Drawframe is essentially a stretching device for sliver used to improve mass
irregularity of sliver and parallelization of fibres",de,8,/noc/courses/noc18/SEM2/noc18-de04
